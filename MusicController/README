A REALLY dumb music controller that takes bytes off a bluetooth
socket from glass and interprets them as button pushes on your
android phone. Requires root on the phone. Doesn't even bother
to launch at startup, open the activity once to start listening.
Crashes if you have any number of bluetooth devices attached but
1.

Why bother?
The cable on my headphones is very long, so pulling my phone out
of my pocket to skip a song takes a lot of effort and requires
folding the cable up. Yes, I'm really that lazy, yes, 1st world
problems (actually, more like 0th world problems...).
