A REALLY dumb music controller that takes bytes off a bluetooth
socket from glass and interprets them as button pushes on your
android phone. Requires root on the phone. Doesn't even bother
to launch at startup, open the activity once to start listening.
Crashes if you have any number of bluetooth devices attached but
1.
