A simple Python app that connects to a local IMAP server and keeps
the set of unread messages in the timeline.
Designed for my own personal server, so it updates very often and
gets glass subscriptions from a CGI script that dumps them to
/tmp/glass_unread instead of sending them between servers or so.
Yes, using DELETE for "mark unread" goes against Glass' design docs
but, oh well.
